# App: UparK

**Team Members:** Adrienne Corwin, Jordan George, Kyra Seevers

**Who developed what in the app?**
- Jordan – map, date range checking, displaying overlays based on data
- Kyra – parking details view, date picker
- Adrienne – parking json data, choose pass view, UI

**Purpose:** Parking on the University of Kentucky's campus is very complicated and hard for students to remember and follow which leads to a lot of anger and frustration.

**Hypothesis:** If there is an application to tell people where they can park for free, students will get less tickets and be happier.

The result is our parking app custom to UK and its permits, hours, lots, streets, and garages.

For best use, we recommend simulating your location on campus, such as at Willy T (401 Hilltop Ave, Lexington, KY 40506).
